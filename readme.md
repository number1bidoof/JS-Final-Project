One of the things I struggled with the most on this project was figuring out how to format the divs and display the information for each individual task. the old way I programed it only worked for 1 individual task to be displayed instead of a group of them

As well having a lot of problems with the divs, I also had a lot of trouble with very minor and small bugs, it took 2 hours for me to remove a line of code, otherwise my project was finished and done.

Since some of the things we did in class, such as objects and stuff with the DOM, they were very easy. I thought that the project was going to be extremely hard but it ended up being enough of a challenge but not too easy. Kind of in the middle

With this project I learned a lot about object programming with JS, this class was very nice
